All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.
